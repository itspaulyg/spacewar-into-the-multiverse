# Spacewar! Into the Multiverse
We propose to recreate the classic game Spacewar! which was developed in the 1960’s by the hackers at MIT. The game consists of two spacecrafts attempting to kill one another with a set amount of torpedoes. We plan to limit the number of torpedoes each spacecraft has and have the spacecrafts continue to move even after you let go of the movement keys (to create a ‘gliding in space’ movement). We plan to have a starry night background and a sun in the center which will destroy your spacecraft if you come in contact with it, similar to the hackers’ implementation. We will also have the hyperspace function, which upon activation will remove the player’s spacecraft from the field until reactivation (about 2 or 3 seconds), whereupon the spacecraft will reappear at a random location on the field.
